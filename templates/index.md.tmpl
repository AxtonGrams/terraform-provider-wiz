# {{.ProviderName}}

The Wiz Terraform provider is designed to work with [Wiz](https://app.wiz.io/). 

The "wiz" provider manages resources typically manually managed in the [Wiz web interface](https://app.wiz.io/).  You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.
